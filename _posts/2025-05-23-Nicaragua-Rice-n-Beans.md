* This country has a trouble past with the USA. It was overthrown and governed by the USA in the early 1900s because it tried to build a canal to rival the Panama canal.
* The present government FSLN is named after Augusto Sandino, a matryr who was killed for trying to gain independence from the US. It has many pros, such as the beautiful roads in contrast with the ones from Honduras, but also has cons like the authoritharian tendencies such as 2018. 
* Crime here is lower than its neighbors by a lot. Looking at you Hondruas, El Salvador...


### Managua Airport

Arriving in the early mornings, I had a Gallo Pinto (rice n beans) breakfast at the airport. Because of the lack of wifi, and little communication from the shared bus from the hostel, I was freaking out at the airport because I thought that I missed my ride. 

Fortunately, the bus was just late, and after an hour in the shared van with around 10 other tourists, I arrived at my hotel, about a 5 mins walk from the Granada city center.

### Granada, the oldest colonial city in NA

I was greeted by the charming colonial buildings of this 500 years old city. Famous for being the conservative counterpart of the other famous city, Leon, Granada has many buildings refurbished just like how it was during the early days.

I was pleasantly surprised by very little Westernization (perhaps a combination of political unstability and low income). I have heard people speak of close relationships with Venezuela, and the hopes for cheaper petro, which is certainly interesting. 

I walked my way to the peers to witness Lake Nicaragua, a giantic lake in the middle of the country.

*The quesillo is a popular wrap of tortilla and cheese with cream toppings.*

Because of the low tourist wet season, our walking tour was cancelled, and I meandered through the markets of Granada. 

![market]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/market.jpeg){:width="50%"}![spices]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/spices.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Spices are sold through bags here. (same with vegetable oil, chicharon and others)*

It is bustling with activity, with street vendors, horses and taxis, and just about everything all at once. 

I went to the local super market and saw some local produce, such as plantain and cassava (yuca). The sudden rain extended my stay at the supermarket, and this reminded me so much of my time in San Salvador in 2022.

### Isletas de Granada and Laguna de Apoyo 

On my second day, I participated in a tour of the surrounding attractions. 

Our first stop was the Isletas tour of the little islands born from the eruption of Volcano Mombacho. There are hundreds of islands, some for private houses of the elites, and some for tourists. 

![isletas]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/isletas.jpeg){:width="50%"}![spider_monkey]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/spider_monkey.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*We fed the spider monekys with bananas, and the tour guide stressed that the monkeys have jumped onto the boat in the past, so we gotta be careful.*

We made a cafe stop on one of the islands with a banos, and saw a few fisherman using various nets to catch fish.

Our last stop was at the San Pablo fort, which the Spanish built because of English and French pirates that often raided the area. 

![island_stop]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/island_stop.jpeg){:width="50%"}![fort]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/fort.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Our second stop was San Juan de Oriente, a village famous for the pottery artisans. 

![pottery1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/pottery1.jpeg){:width="50%"}![pottery2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/pottery2.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Our workshop consisted of an end to end demonstration of the pottery process. We started from clay rocks that are grinded down, to wheel throwing, then to the rock-based coloring of the pots, before etching from bones and polishings from seeds, which concluded in an oven process of about a week. 

The end product is just beautiful. And I bought a traditional clay whistle as a sourvenir.

Our next stop is a town called Catarina, which had a beautiful view of Laguna de Apoyo. The lake is a volano lake, neither salt water nor fresh water.  

![guides]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/guides.jpeg){:width="50%"}![mirador]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/mirador.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Just look at this view! I can see the whole Laguna de Apoyo in all its beauty. 

![laguna_apoyo]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/laguna_apoyo.jpeg){:width="50%"}![laguna_apoyo2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/laguna_apoyo2.jpeg){:width="50%"}

*Lunch with my guide, I had the tostones, and he had the local Tona beer*

Our final stop of the day is the Laguna Beach Club, a hostel which also sold day passes to its water activities. 

I spent the next 2 hours kayaking and sipping on the famous cacao drink (full of chocolate flavors). See the volcano smokes and the lush green mountain side are just incredible.

After saying goodbye to my guides, I climbed the Granada church's towers as the sun was setting. 

![granada_church]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/granada_church.jpeg){:width="50%"}![fsln]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/fsln.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Interestingly, the political party had an office here*

### Granada city

I started my third day trying to go on the walking tour yet again. As fate would have it, I was the only person that showed up. Enrique and I had a good laugh, being a great guide, he said that he'd show me where the good Vigaron (a local delicacy is).

![granada_market]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/granada_market.jpeg){:width="50%"}![oxtail_soup]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/oxtail_soup.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Our search led us to the local market. In the food section, we spoke with an amazing grandpa who was making his signature oxtail soup. 

We continued deeper into the market, and stopped at a cheese vendor to try some salty cheese. Out of nowhere, Enrique told me that this is his girlfriend and she started to punch him :) it was so funny.

![enrique_girlfriend]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/enrique_girlfriend.jpeg){:width="50%"}![enrique_walkingtour]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/enrique_walkingtour.jpeg){:width="50%"}

He spoke in depth about the surrounding fancy colonial buildings, about their history of abandonment and restoration. 

True to his words, we grab the most delicious Vigaron with the amazing combination of melting beef, steamed cassava and sour salad. 

![vigaron]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/vigaron.jpeg){:width="65%"}![vigaron2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/vigaron2.jpeg){:width="23%"}

I continued the day on my own, walking to the parks and churchs, and went to a cigar factory for a tour of cigar making. 

![horse]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/horse.jpeg){:width="50%"}![cigar_factory]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/cigar_factory.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Horses are everywhere in the city as a means of transportation, I don't think I had seen this sight since my 2022 Guyana trip.*

In the afternoon, I got myself a haircut ($200 Cordobas), picked up a Tona shirt with a Gueguense mask on the sleeves. 

Then I waited patiently to learn the secrets of Chocolate making from the museum. 

![national_bird]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/national_bird.jpeg){:width="50%"}![gueguense]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/gueguense.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Some cultural tidbits from the Museum decor, featuring the national bird (shared w/ El Salvador) and the El Gueguense masks*

Antony was my teacher and he made the 2 hours go fast. He was very interactive, and we spoke about his time in Germany and Costa Rica. 

We started from picking up the Cocoa fruit from the mini plantation, and talked about the fermentation process for the seeds to go from white to dark brown

![cocoa0]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/cocoa0.jpeg){:width="50%"}![cocoa1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/cocoa1.jpeg){:width="28%"}
*Because we are past the optimal season to harvest, the seeds are actually sprouting already inside.*

We then started roasting the seeds, where they made noises like popcorn. 

![cocoa3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/cocoa3.jpeg){:width="28%"}![cocoa4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/cocoa4.jpeg){:width="50%"}

After cooling off a bit, we peeled the cocoa beans, and took the core to the mortar and pestle to grind the cocoa beans into cocoa nibs. 

![cocoa5]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/cocoa5.jpeg){:width="50%"}![cocoa6]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/cocoa6.jpeg){:width="50%"}

We adjusted the mixtures with water and milk, and after filtering a few times, we got ourselves some basic cocoa drinks. Because of the time that it takes to make chocolates, we did a timeskip into the next steps. 

![cocoa7]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/cocoa7.jpeg){:width="50%"}![cocoa8]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nicaragua/cocoa8.jpeg){:width="28%"}

Because of the limited storage, I skipped the pictures about spreading out the chocolate paste mixture, and mixing them over and over again, horizontally and vertically. 

The final result was a mold of chocolate liquid that went into the refrigerator.
