I am only in Qatar for about 18 hours. Let's go explore! 

Some aspects of my Qatar trip that I find really unique:

* The country only has around 50 years of modern history. Previously a British protectorate, Qatar discovered oil and transformed. 
* Qataris are a minority in their own country, as most of the population is made up of expatriates working in the country.
* The national animal is the Arabian desert Oryx, same logo as Qatar Airways. 
* Taxis or metro here are very affordable because of the abundant oil. Subway tickets cost only around 60 cents. 

### Arriving in Doha

Did you know that Qatar Airways' map always has a mode that displays the distance to Makkah (the most holy Islamic city)? 

The artificial islands dominate the skyline of Doha - signaling the modernity of the country. 

The airport itself is extremely modern, and a top contender for the best airport in the world. Similar to another best-airport-contender, Singapore, it has an orchid park inside the airport.

I had booked the Discover Qatar tour and traveled with the official tour group to see the city. Our guide was a Czech who had lived in Qatar for 4 years. She was ecstatic that she didn't pay personal income tax, and that the cost of living was cheaper than in Prague. 

### Corniche District and Katara Cultural Village

Our first stop was the Corniche district waterfront. 

Being an ultra-modern country, Qatar is also very conscious of its Islamic heritage. You can see the traditional Dhow boats floating in front of the skyscrapers. I found the juxtaposition of the old and new both humbling and interesting. 

The national museum glistened in the night. It's a shame that I can't visit it this time.

Qatar is investing heavily in sports. Remnants of the World Cup 2022 are still visible. In addition to soccer, Formula 1 is also very popular. 

We visited an amazing mosque in the cultural center, with a beautiful interior. 

I was amazed to see street vendors kneel down to pray at one of the prayer times in the night.

The extravagance in the area was incredible. My visit coincided with an art festival, and the night life was bustling.

### Souq Waqif 

The highlight of my trip was definitely the Souq Waqif. It was similar to my time visiting the Medina in Tunisia, with market and street food vendors everywhere.

All the vendors (unlike those in Tunisia) spoke English - meaning plenty of bargaining. I saw many Chinese tourists in the crowd, and the main attraction was the gold thumb art. 

I also shopped around for souvenirs and sampled a Turkish streetfood called Tantuni, which I think is a spicy-focused variant of the shawarma wrap and chapati.

### Leaving Qatar

Despite my short stay, Qatar left a lasting impression. The country has successfully balanced tradition with modernization - something that became clear as our bus passed by the Sheikh's private airport terminal, ornate Islamic Embassy buildings, and luxurious villas on the way back to the airport.

Unlike Dubai's bold extravagance, Qatar feels more grounded - proudly showcasing its Islamic heritage while confidently stepping into the future. Their strategy of diversifying beyond oil through tourism, sports, and culture is clearly working.

This 18-hour glimpse has only made me eager to return and explore more of what this fascinating country has to offer.
