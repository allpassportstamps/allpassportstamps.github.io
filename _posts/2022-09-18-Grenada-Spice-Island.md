My first time ever in the Caribbean with to St. Thomas, a US Virgin Island. Grenada was my second time ever to the region. 

*Unfortunately, I lost most of my photos from Grenada (same reason as Belize) due to a backup error. I hope that I can recall the trip as well as possible.* 

Some aspects of the Grenada trip that I find really unique: 
* I barely missed Hurricane Ian. I was looking up the weather every few hours throughout the trip. Fortunately and unfortunately, Hurrican Ian missed Grenada and landed in Florida a few days later. 
* French then British colony
* Uses the East Caribbean Dollar currency shared between multiple island countries
* I love the Creole spoken there - my Airbnb host said to me "Do you want some chow?" and it took me a whole 20 seconds to figure it out.

I took a short trip yet again over a long weekend to the Carribean. I arrived in Grenada on a Sunday afternoon. I rented a car and was driving on the left hand side. 

I had a hard time finding the Airbnb, which is a backyard house with air conditioning. The host had the cutest chicken and dogs. 

I was staying close to Grand Anse beach, and grabbed dinner there. I also bought my SIM card from a vendor - somehow I managed to offend her and I probably should have tried harder on figuring out how to activate the sim. 

### Around the island we go

The next morning, I drove around the island. 

I visited the Annandale Waterfall, a really cozy spot tucked in between the mountains full of green.

*The cutest dogs were in the entrance booth*

I also visited Belmont Estate, a former plantation, which now has tours on the various produce. I tried some different colored chocolates and brought some back.

*Gosh I really wish that I didn't lose all these photos*

I visited the River Sall√©e Boiling Springs, a relatively hidden mud bath place off the road. After walking down bushes and seeing leashed-up goats, I was greeted by the shops that offered mud massages.

These holes in the ground with mud supposedly have healing properties.

I drove back towards the east side of the island. The road conditions definitely gave me trouble. 


I made my way to Greville, the second largest town in Grenada. The town has two big one way streets and street vendors and shops were everywhere. 

I had lunch at a Chinese restaurant called New Thriving. The owners thought that I was a Chinese international student studying at St. George's University, and I learned that they have immigrated for a long time. 

I made 2 stops to the True Blue Beach, a beautiful beach (with no one there and garbage everywhere), and St. George's University, a university with resort vibes. 

### Spice Island

Grenada is known for the spices that it grows. I visited The Tower Estate, a farm and factory for these spices in jars. The tour was fantastic where I tasted all sorts of jams made from various fruits, especially the nutmeg. 

I also stopped by the fort (Fort Frederick) along the way, where I could oversea the whole western side of the island. Of course, hundreds of years ago, there were probably guards who watched for pirate ships all day in these walls.

### St George

The main town of St George was crowded. There were quite a few small malls and tourist traps along the docks. According to the locals, that's where the cruise ships usually stop for a few hours during the summer travel season.

I walked for a few hours, as I parked far away, and visited a bunch of the local shops.

As the days went by, I visited Grand Anse beach again, and spent some time in Spiceland Mall, where the locals would visit regularly.

I hope to be back to more Caribbean islands throughout the next few decades!
