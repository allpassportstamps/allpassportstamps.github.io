Although I was only in SG for two days, I'm sure I'll be coming back many times in the future decades, because it's a frequent stopover hub.

Some aspects of the Singapore trip that I find really unique:
* A peaceful mix of Chinese, Indian, and Arab peoples who speak English
* A benevolent dictatorship (loosely) at its finest, showcased by LKY's achievements
* Hawker centers are perfect

I arrived in SG in the morning. The SE Asia hot and humid weather is a constant. I checked into my hotel at Tanjong Pagar and got exploring.

### Hawker Center 

First things first, I went to the Maxwell Hawker that's about two minutes away.

*Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken - Michelin Star restaurant*

The hawker center was less busy in the morning, allowing me to enjoy the Michelin-starred meal without a long wait. The restaurant name translates directly into "everyday ginger chicken". Needless to say the hainan chicken was fragrant. 

Over the next two days, I mostly ate in hawker centers. They offer not only Chinese food but also Indian and Arab cuisines.

What an experience having satay at midnight or laksa for dinner üòç

### Ethnic Enclaves 

As a former British colony, Singapore's strategic geography and historical developments with Malaysia have resulted in very diverse demographics: (from Wikipedia) *15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians*. 

Lee Kuan Yew and his government are largely credited with the amazing transformation of SG. From unifying on the English language to industrializing and transitioning to its modern economy, Singapore has done a lot to be the jewel of South East Asia. 

Perhaps modern China is the way that it is because of LKY's influence as well. 

The ethnic enclaves came from the Stamford Raffles (British official in the early 1800s) days. This creates this unique blend of neighborhoods so close to each other.

*Chinese and Indian (hindu)*

*Arab quarters* 

I do apologize for attempting to draw generalizations, but we need to generalize sometimes to have the right mental models for the world. Hopefully LKY would agree with my viewpoint. 

This cultural mixture is precious. I wonder if this peace is only achievable due to the environment of rapid, upward mobility in development. Or perhaps there is a common understanding amongst people after the decades of colonial rule and three years of Japanese occupation. 

### Local Life 

I visited the famous Housing Development Board "museum" that Singaporians have. Having seen blocks of government housing everywhere in the world and the usual stereotypes, I am very impressed.

I also visited the National University of Singapore.

I walked for a good 30 minutes to the nearest Ikea and had some Asian food in the Ikea cafeteria.

*They also have the usual meatballs, of course*

Life is busy, but good.

### Marina Bay Sands

Marina Bay sands is so big and green. I decided to watch the sunset and observe this mega structure.

Buildings in SG place a strong emphasis on green design, and rightly so.

The night before my flight, I walked Orchard road, the upscale shopping center of SG.

Being in SEA, the convenience stores are heaven, of course. 

### Saying Goodbye

I spent quite a few hours at the Changi airport. It is an attraction in of itself. Unfortunately, I couldn't catch the Jewel with the falling water. 

At the airport lounge, I made myself some laksa from the self-serve kit and had the perfect ending to my brief stay in SG.
