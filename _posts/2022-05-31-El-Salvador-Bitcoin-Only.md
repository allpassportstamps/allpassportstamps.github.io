I arrived at San Salvador late in the evening. After a good night sleep, I went and checked out their town square and museums.

Central America was once united as the Federal Republic of Central America, and of course there has been a lot of conflict in the region.

### Bitcoin Only? 

El Salvador's currency is the US dollar.

>Of course, everything is cheaper - for instance, a sim card is $1. 

President Nayib Bukele and the government has also introduced Bitcoin as an official currency.

Although it's not used much by the locals, I am impressed by the adoption and futuristic vision. 

### Bitcoin Beach

I visited the beautiful beaches of El Salvador facing the Pacific - El Tunco and El Zonte. 

El Tunco is much bigger and more popular with the locals . There is a large pier and a busy market. It's a blend of industrials, vacations and surfers!

About 20 mins by car, there is El Zonte, better known to tourists as Bitcoin beach. 

All the shops do accept Bitcoin through the government payment app. Of course, the shops and resorts are higher end and there are mostly tourists there.

### Pupusas

It's their national dish. 

Fresh pupusas are made everywhere on the streets. The cheese and fillings are blended in front of your eyes into a steamy bun of goodness.
