I was cautious, given El Salvador's murder capital reputation. 

I arrived at San Salvador late in the evening. After a good night sleep, I went and checked out their town square and museums.

Central America was once united as the Federal Republic of Central America, and of course there has been a lot of conflict in the region.

### Bitcoin Only? 

El Salvador has been using the US dollar.

>It's so interesting to see $1 sim cards being sold on the streets, where as I am used to $20-$50 ones in the US.  

This changed when President Nayib Bukele pushed the country towards a monetary system consisting of Bitcoin.

Although it's not used much by the locals, I was very impressed by how widely accepted Bitcoin is by bigger corporations. 

### Bitcoin Beach

I visited the beautiful beaches of El Salvador facing the Pacific - El Tunco then El Zonte. 

El Tunco is a much bigger and popular beach. There is a large pier and a busy market. It's a mix of industrials, vacations and surfers!

About 20 mins by car, there is El Zonte, better known to tourists as Bitcoin beach. 

All the shops do accept Bitcoin through the government payment app. Of course, the shops and resorts are higher end and there are mostly tourists there.

### Pupusas

There is something so fresh about seeing fresh pupusas made on the streets. The cheese and fillings blend so perfectly.
