![Gambia Flag]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/flags/4x3/gm.svg){:height="36px" width="36px"} Gambia \| Country 38 \| 2 days \|

* The Gambia is named after the Gambia River and is almost completely surrounded by Senegal; it was the superhighway of West Africa in the past
* There is a stereotype that older European women come here to mingle with young Gambian men
* Mandinka and Wolof are the main ethnic groups here
* Previously colonized by the British; in the 1980s, it formed the Senegambia Confederation with Senegal
* Right below the Sahara, The Gambia is lush, green, and full of rain; for a country where the GDP per capita is less than $800, there are cell signals everywhere in the country

Arriving at Senegambia in the evening, I took a taxi ride from Banjul Airport to the lively strip full of people having a good time. After checking into the hotel, I wandered the streets for some dinner.

### Day 1: Village tour

> You know that cliché image of African children swarming a foreigner? It sounds so cliché, but this does happen in rural villages here.

I woke up in the morning to meet my guide, Kayce. Today, we were going on a remote village tour. 

The weather was pouring rain (this was the wet season), and the car leaked water in the front passenger seat. Every couple of minutes, Kayce would wipe the fog from the windshield using a rag. 

We drove to downtown Banjul and then to the port. We were taking the ferry north across the Gambia River. We walked a bit and got our tickets to ride the ferry.

![boats]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/boats.jpeg){:width="50%"}![port]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/port.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Up on the top, open-air deck, we could see all the cars driving onto the ferry, as well as the Gambia River. There were many smaller transport boats and fishing boats crossing the river as well.  

After about an hour, we arrived in Barra. 

The port of Barra is intense. I was swarmed by the bustle of the town. Cars, people, and vendors were everywhere. 

Kayce asked if I wanted to use the bathroom. I said yes. We went to two restaurants and were turned away. We then wandered into a government building. Suddenly, I saw bars and hands behind them. This was a friggin' prison. Kayce walked past the front-desk police officer before he was told no and we had to leave. We gave up on using the bathroom.

![port2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/port2.jpeg){:width="50%"}

After some intense bargaining at the market, we finally had a taxi to go to Kebbeh, a small town in the north. 

As we drove away from the town, it dawned on me that this might be the least economically developed country I have ever visited. The Gambia is ranked in the 160s of all countries. Given that there is no war, The Gambia is really not very developed. 

After a 15-minute taxi ride, I found myself in the middle of the Saturday market. 

![market]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/market.jpeg){:width="50%"}![tea]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/tea.jpeg){:width="50%"}

There were so many animals in the streets. People were selling items for farming, bags of onions, other foods, seeds—just everything. 

Here we met K, the local tour organizer. He introduced me to the vendors at the market and what they were selling. 

![market2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/market2.jpeg){:width="50%"}![donkey]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/donkey.jpeg){:width="50%"}

I was really surprised to see so many donkey carts, and K just walked up to an eight-ish-year-old boy, paid him some money, and let me ride the donkey cart for a bit. Wow.

After seeing the main market street, we walked towards our host's home. 

![baobab]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/baobab.jpeg){:width="28%"}

Baobab, the most important tree for Senegalese and Gambian folks.

We said hello to the host family. Immediately, two women greeted us; one was breastfeeding a baby. They sat around an open-air stove with a big pot and explained that they were cooking lunch.

The grandma of the family was lying on the mat across the front porch. Men walked around or watched soccer (football) on the TV. 

Some very young sheep just sat on the ledges and roamed freely in the village corridor. 

Walking through the back door, we passed even more livestock from the host family and walked a bit to K's guest home. 

![village_host]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/village_host.jpeg){:width="50%"}

K's guest house had 2 dogs, 2 turkeys, and a bunch of pheasants and chickens. He explained that he is building a guest house in the village because it is close to many local tourist attractions. 

Then, along with two of his friends, K, Kayce, and I went around on a donkey ride.  

![donkey_ride]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/donkey_ride.jpeg){:width="38%"}![livestock_market]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/livestock_market.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Right: Livestock market with many goats and horses. One of the men told me about visiting Shanghai in the early 2000s.*

On the donkey's cart, we saw many farm fields. This was the growing season (September). K explained that most farmers grow peanuts, millet, and rice.

After the donkey ride, we went back to the host family's residence. 

We were eating a traditional West African meal. On the floor! Everyone was kneeling on the floor, eating with their hands. As the foreigner, I was given a spoon. 

There was a big pot of food—jollof rice, fish, vegetables, and many spices. There were maybe three women, three men, and about ten kids. 

![village_food]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/village_food.jpeg){:width="50%"}![food_together]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/food_together.jpeg){:width="38%"}

The patriarch of the family was organizing the eating. He broke off the main chicken and put pieces of meat in front of everyone. The rice, the spice, and the protein tasted amazing. What a fascinating tradition, which I learned [more about](https://www.accessgambia.com/information/food-bowl.html) after the fact.

One girl from the family was wearing the hijab, while the younger ones were not. 

After the meal, we hung out some more in K's home and made our way back to Senegambia. We got a ride from K's neighbor, who was heading into Barra. 

We had probably just missed the boat and waited an hour or more at the Barra port. 

Kayce and I talked a bit with the army guards at the port. They had tiny teapots brewing Arabic tea, and one of them was dancing. 

Kayce showed me that there were many smaller boats carrying cargo. Men would walk back and forth, carrying stacks of food, rice, and more on their heads. The boats were so colorful! 


![barra_transport]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/barra_transport.jpeg){:width="50%"}

As we finally boarded the ferry, the rain started to pour, and everyone hid and huddled together on the packed-to-the-brim ship. There was a truck in front of us with a tiny sheep in the back along with two guys. 

![ferry]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/ferry.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Finally arriving on the Banjul side of the Gambia River, we saw many kids playing soccer on the beach with the sunset in the backdrop. What a beautiful view!

![kids]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/kids.jpeg){:width="50%"}![kid]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/kid.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Right: He asked me to take a picture of him, and I told him that I will remember him forever.*

After such a wonderful day with Kayce, I called it a day. 

![boat]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/boat.jpeg){:width="50%"}

I walked a few minutes to the Atlantic Ocean and had domoda, a peanut-based local staple.

![hotel]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/hotel.jpeg){:width="50%"}![domoda]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/domoda.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*The drink is called bissap (hibiscus). The other popular drink is the baobab drink.*

### Day 2: Banjul and Initiation Ceremony

I woke up to some surprise guests on my way to breakfast. The hotel had very few guests because of the wet season, so I guess new ones popped up on their own. Today, I was taking a half-day tour to some tourist places around Banjul and Serekunda.

![breakfast]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/breakfast.jpeg){:width="50%"}![wuri]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/wuri.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Pablo, my tour guide, and I drove to Arch 22. On the way there, we saw many vultures hanging out on the streets. 

We climbed up the Arch, which got its name after the July 22, 1994 coup. The view of the city, the mosques, and the houses were amazing; Banjul is on an island connected to mainland Gambia. 

![arch22]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/arch22.jpeg){:width="50%"}

At the very top of the Arch, there was a history museum detailing the coup that took place, where a young Lt. staged a coup and did not step down until 2017. 

![display]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/display.jpeg){:width="28%"}![disappear]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/disappear.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Journalists, businessmen and more disappeared in these 22 years.*

Our next stop was the Kachikally Crocodile Pool and museum. We first drove to the town of Bakau, which had narrow streets and many young children.

The museum portion of the attraction detailed the history of The Gambia and its many ethnic groups, like the Mandinka. I learned about spirit traditions.

![mask]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/mask.jpeg){:width="28%"}![jola_drum]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/jola_drum.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Left: The Kankurang, a revered protective spirit in The Gambia; Right: Jola drum*

There were many details about the tradition of both male and female circumcision, where boys go with their shaman, fathers, and uncles to the bushes for manhood lessons for a month.

*Left: Calabash; Right: Being a former British colony, Gambian soldiers fought in Burma?*

We then visited the crocodile pool, where the crocs only eat fish, and I had the opportunity to touch its soft scaly belly. 

After leaving the pool, our next stop was the Serekunda market. Serekunda is the biggest city in The Gambia, and the market was a fantastic and crazy experience. 

![serekunda_market]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/serekunda_market.jpeg){:width="28%"}![serekunda_market2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/serekunda_market2.jpeg){:width="50%"}

I ended up buying a traditional Kora instrument and a batik shirt. 

As we left Serekunda and drove towards the Monkey Sanctuary, we ran into a mass of folks walking towards us. One of them was wearing a pink costume, playing the role of the Kankurang spirit. Another boy was making loud noises. 

![IMG_3508]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/IMG_3508.jpeg){:width="35%"}![IMG_3509]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/IMG_3509.jpeg){:width="35%"}

A boy walked to the car and Pablo gave some small change and explained that this is a boy's initiation ceremony. They were walking towards the salt water (Atlantic Ocean) to clean the wound, as tradition dictates. 

![initiation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/initiation.jpeg){:width="65%"}

Our final stop was the monkey sanctuary, where monkeys are free to come and go. There are two types of monkeys: the typical yellow-gray ones and the red ones. 

![monkey]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/monkey.jpeg){:width="28%"}

We bought some bananas. Pablo instructed me to stand still and hold my hand close to my chest. Sure enough, a monkey jumped onto my shoulder and ate the banana.

After the tour, I spent the afternoon at the local fancy mall, where there was A/C, giving shelter from the heat. In the mall, at the pastry shop, I witnessed the famous situationship between older white women and younger Gambians.

![wait]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gambia/wait.jpeg){:width="50%"}

As the evening approached, I ate my final meal in The Gambia. I had the baobab drink while the rain fell.
