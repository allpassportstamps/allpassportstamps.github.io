I escaped the cold of Canada and arrived at Montego Bay, where I spent the last few days of 2022!

Some aspects of the Jamaica trip that I find really unique: 
* Beef patties that are so very very popular in Canada
* Bigger, more developed but also more crowded than other Caribbeans that I have been to
* The amount of vendors selling weed on the streets to tourists 
* Usain Bolt and his Bolt-themed restaurants

### Who has the best patties? 

Did you know that there are 60 Juici Patties  and 4 Tastee Patties locations all around Jamaica? 

Interestingly enough, Tastee Patties were started and are operated by the Chang family.

I just can't get enough of the beef patties. All the memories of my childhood snacks are rushing back.

### Montego Bay

I checked into my hotel within walking distance of downtown. It's almost a resort with a pool and large venue. A wedding was hosted at the hotel a few days later with 50+ people and it was quite an experience for me to watch from afar.

Montego Bay is crowded and touristy, just like Hawaii.

The downtown is mostly shops, along with a museum and Sam Sharpe square.

There are a few structures from the old days as well.

I strolled through the main beach called Harmony Beach. It was a Christmas paradise. I am sure that the beaches are much busier during cruise ship season.

The beach has tight security with bag checks. There are many bathrooms and towel places, along with gigantic floating playgrounds in the water. 

### Local food

Quite a few nuggets of goodness all around the island.

Jerk chicken is of course famous for its smoky and fragrant taste. This peanut porridge holds its own.

This fried dough is called a "festival," and it's sweet with some cinnamon flavors. Sugar canes are also very popular in the island heat.

### The Hip Strip

The Hip Strip are where all the resorts and night life are happening. There are an endless amount of weed and cigar shops on this strip.

Alongside Starbucks and many mom and pop shops, there is a beach called Doctor's Cave that supposedly is famous for healing properties.

I visited Bolt's restaurant and museum. Funnily enough, I saw on the news a few days prior that Mr Bolt was close to being broke because of a recent scandal involving the largest Jamaican financial institution.

### Local Life

I spent two days touring the local side of Jamaica. 

![bookstore]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/jamaica/bookstore.jpeg){:width="50%"}![cutting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/jamaica/cutting.jpeg){:width="50%"}

A lot of books and jobs are dedicated to the hospitality and hotel industry.

Look at these porridges, and Callaloo n' Saltfish!

I had one final meal and walked about 30 minutes to the airport.
