Ms. Q and I are visiting the Aussies for Thanksgiving! Specifically, we'll be visiting Sydney (New South Wales), Cairns and Brisbane (Queensland).

* There are more kangaroos (40m) than people (26m) in Australia! The government encourages citizens to hunt and eat kangaroo due to their over population.
* James cook, 1770, sailed Australia's coasts. It was originally populated by British prison convicts. Then gold was discovered (there is a popular beach outside of Brisbane called Gold Beach), before federating into a country in 1901. 
* Like the Kiwis to the east, Aussies face very similar social issues for housing, native rights, but an overall slower pace of life compared to where we live.

### Day 1: Sydney Taronga Zoo, UofSydney and Chinatown

Upon leaving our luggage at the hotel, Ms. Q and I took the bus to visit Taronga zoo. We were greeted by a beautiful koala statue.

We roamed the Australian section of the zoo with wonder and amusement. There is a giant fenced enclosure with Kangaroos and Emus (the Australian coat of arms), where roos relaxed everywhere.
