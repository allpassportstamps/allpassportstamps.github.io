>As I am writing this post in 2024, I realized that this trip was the beginning of my love for adventure. I was young and took many things for granted... What I would give up to go back in time and tell myself to treasure this time and this youth. 

Back in 2019, I went on an amazing work trip with colleagues to Germany. 

The person that I was in 2019 is best described as a workaholic. I spent only a few days exploring and spent the vast majority of the trip networking and making career connections. 

I will be back one day!  

## Frankfurt to Wurzburg

The conference took place in Wurzburg about an hour away from Frankfurt. 

I arrived in the late afternoon and made my way by train. 

Finding the Airbnb and the host (Arman?) was quite the experience. 

Wurzburg is a college town; it has a beautiful town square, modern retail and coffee shops everywhere!

What a lively evening! Music, food and happy smiles.

## Work Conference

Waking up after some jetlag, I walked through the town towards the bus for Wurzburg university. 

The university buildings were historical, yet their facilities were modern.

The work conference was fantastic. Our work presentation went well and many months of hard work paid off.

The trip is now a blur in my memories, but I do remember
* The beautiful river
* The bougie coffee shops
* The old castles 

## Saying Goodbye

The trip was short and I wish I had stayed to visit Berlin or Cologne.
