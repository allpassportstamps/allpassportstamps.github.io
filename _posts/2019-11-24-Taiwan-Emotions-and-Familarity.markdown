Taiwan was and is an emotional place for me. I spent Thanksgiving 2019 there. 

To me, the place is best described as 80% China and 20% Japan. 

I arrived on a rainy night. Took the train and checked into the hotel. 

### Convenience Stores 

Like many people, I am a fanatic about convenience stores in Asia.

From snacks to meals to every day items, 7 Eleven and Family Mart have everything. 

It's cool to see Taiwan's calendar system. Year 108 or 109 - 1911 was when China's Qing dynasty was taken over by the former Chinese ruling party. 

It's fascinating to see Taiwan's unique calendar system, which was in the year 108 in 2019, marking the years since the overthrow of China's Qing dynasty in 1911 by the present government (former ruling party of China).

### Taipei 101 and Elephant Mountain

I checked out the local attractions, climbed the 101, and visited Elephant Mountain not far away.

The rainy nights envelop the city in a charm that's hard to resist.

### Tours

I visited the national museum and greatly enjoyed learning about Chinese history and exploring my roots. I recall the subway ride and watching the busy cosmopolitan life that goes around me.

I also made my way to the Zoo, rode the Gondola to Maokong Station and took in the view of Taipei.

### Food and Night Markets 

Taiwan's night markets are a fantastic kaleidoscope of sights, sounds, and smells. There are quite a few big markets and I really enjoyed visiting 6-8 of them over the span of a week.

I also visited Jiufen, famous for the Spirited Away references. And, of course, I visited Ding Tai Fung, famously originating in Taiwan.

### Remembering the Past

Like many Asian countries, including its Chinese counterpart, Taiwan's dirty secret was called the White Terror. It paved the way towards Taiwan's industrialization and the present day mega economy.

Thanksgiving holidays came to an end and I said good bye to this beautiful city.
