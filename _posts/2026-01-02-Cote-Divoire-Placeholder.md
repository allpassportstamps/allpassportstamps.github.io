![Cote Divoire Flag]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/flags/4x3/ci.svg){:height="36px" width="36px"} Benin \| Country 41 \| 3 day \|

Regrettably I am only in Ivory Coast for 3 days. I will definitely be back to explore the country more. 

* Much more economically developed than other West African countries (2x higher GDP per capita than Benin), #1 exporter of cocoa in the world
* History of relative stability (except the coop in 1999)
* Higher Muslim population (40%) than Benin (15%), but lower than Senegal (95%). Folks dress significantly less West African (not the colorful clothes).

As I got off the plane, in the custom lines, I met a nice couple from IL, USA, who were Jehovah's Witnesses and went to a conference in Togo, then traveled to Benin and will be continuing their journey in Cote d'Ivoire.

I took an easy Yango ride to my hotel in Abidjan's Plateau area (which is very similar to Manhattan, many tall buildings and on an island). Throughout the ride, I was excited to see many modern malls and cars on the road (instead of the motorbikes in Benin). Interestingly, hotels here have a government registration web form (which reminds me a lot of China).

### Day 2: Treichville and Grand Bassam

Waking up early in the morning, I first explored the Pyramid and Salam Mosque. Because my walking tour was delayed to my last day in Cote d'Ivoire, I will cover it later in the blog.

*breakfast stand in Plateau*

I traveled to Treichville, just south of Plateau. My first stop was the Grand Marche, which was a super crowded building divided into sections. I traversed the cooking section, produce section and got out at the chicken section. 

![marche]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/marche.jpeg){:width="50%"}![street]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/street.jpeg){:width="50%"}

I wandered the streets of Treichville before visiting the Cap Sud mall. The mall contains many modern amenities and brands.

*Right: masks made from cow bones*

The CAVA souvenir market was next. Having been to many souvenir markets, I found many high quality souvenirs here, beyond the wooden masks and magnets that you typically see. They have many bone-carved arts, glass arts (like in Senegal) and my favorite, the coconut arts. Elephant symbols were everywhere and it was very high quality. 

In the afternoon, I had booked a tour at Grand Bassam and took an hour long Yango along the Atlantic ocean. We saw many small shops, folks waiting for shared buses and some super modern houses as we got closer to Grand Bassam.

> A hustler along the road was selling 2 turtles, 1 in each hand on the side of the road.

Arriving an hour earlier than the tour, I meandered the small island of the smaller GB. There were many aggressive fake guides and overly expensive restaurants on the beach unfortunately. 

![beach]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/beach.jpeg){:width="50%"}![tree]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/tree.jpeg){:width="28%"}
*The ocean is beautiful and many people were in the water, with horse rides being sold too.*

Hungry, I ate at a stand a strip away from the beach. I watched the cook make omelette + spaghetti, while a woman next to me put attieke into smaller bags for sale.

My guide Merceline and I had been communicating on WhatsApp and unfortunately she ran pretty late. 

> Once the capital of French côte d'ivoire from 1893, but abandoned in 1899 because of yellow fever; Portuguese and Dutch were here for a long time since the 1400s. 

Merceline drew me a picture in the sand of GB's map. GB was divided by the French into a rectangle with 4 sections: resident, administrative, commercial, village (for the African community). 

![map]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/map.jpeg){:width="50%"}![hospital]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/hospital.jpeg){:width="50%"}

The buildings in Bassam were mostly built when GB was the capital. Since abandonment, many buildings are abandoned, but some were maintained. 

We toured the resident section, and she told me about these important French officials or merchants and their houses. We walked through the first schools, the first hospitals, the first church...etc. There had a distinct French colonial style. 

![gov1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/gov1.jpeg){:width="50%"}![gov2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/gov2.jpeg){:width="28%"}

We walked through the governors' office that is now the costume museum featuring the Akan (Ghanaian tribes) and other tribes like Dan that were here.

*Right: These cones are very popular here in Cote d'Ivoire instead of cylindrical structures or posts?*

We walked through the first hotels and a restaurant that everyone loves called La Case Bleue.

> Syrians were brought here in the 1920s, to be the small shops and distributors. They played a similar role to the Lebanese folks in Cote d'Ivoire and French colonies. At this time, Syria and Lebanon were both Ottoman Empire.

*Left: These are dancers' posts where people dance and share news? | Right: Africa Cup is ongoing.*

Walking through the villager sections, we saw lively streets in which many Africans still live in today with shops striving. 

![gb7]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/gb7.jpeg){:width="50%"}![gb8]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/gb8.jpeg){:width="50%"}

We went to the beach to watch the sunset with the fishing boats and village in the backdrop.  Merceline heard that I wanted to try garba (attieke, fish, spices) and we went to a restaurant together.

![gb9]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/gb9.jpeg){:width="50%"}![gb10]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/gb10.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Left: The King's palace of the Akan people built in 2003. There is a distinctive king's stone.*

I tried garba (attieke + fish + spices) with my hand and it was like a fish rice ball once I blended everything together. Merceline asked me to make a good video testimony for her and I did just that.

The time is now 6:30pm in the evening. The sky is drawing darker.

I tried to find a Yango over and over again. But drivers were either all busy, or kept on declining / canceling the rides. We walked a bit to sit by La Case Bleue, the popular restaurant.

At some point, Merceline called her brother to ask if her neighbor a driver would be close by. We even walked towards her house. She mentioned that a passenger yesterday also had issues with Yangos.  As the night drew, we became more and more worried.

![yango1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/yango1.jpeg){:width="18%"}![yango2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/yango2.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Finally, after a whole hour, a miracle driver accepted and get me back to Abidjan. Phew!!! I need to get myself home before dark with more buffer room in the future. 

### Day 3: Largest Church in the World, Yamoussoukro

I was greeted in the early morning by Merceline (guide from yesterday who offered this opportunity) and our driver for the day. 

![roadtrip]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/roadtrip.jpeg){:width="28%"}

It's a 2.5 hour road trip to the capital; the road will be a straight one directly from Abidjan. On the road, there were scarcely any villages; forests dominate. We saw a giant truck flipped over, with dead cows scattered on the ground, along with still surviving cows on a hill. 

At around noon, we finally arrived in the capital, Yamoussoukro. This city was a village in the 1950s, home to the first president, who transformed it. The city is relatively small and sparse.

![foundation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/foundation.jpeg){:width="50%"}![senate]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/senate.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Our first stop was the first president's foundation. This is where the current senate meets. The upstairs is a museum that discribes Boigny Félix Houphouët (BFH)'s life. BFH can be summarized to be someone who was very pro-french and has close connections to the elites in France. BFH did help draft the bill to end forced labor in French West Africa in 1946.

![village]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/village.jpeg){:width="28%"}![rda]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/rda.jpeg){:width="28%"}

> BFH was the chief of his tribe (the Baoule). He let his brother take the chief position, to go study medicine in France. He worked in French parliment and rose through the ranks, before the French allowed CI to be come independent in 1960. He was a one-party president built many grandiose structures.

As we drove to our next stop, we could see it from a far away. 

![basilica1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/basilica1.jpeg){:width="50%"}![basilica2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cote_divoire/basilica2.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Merceline was super helpful and helped me not pay quite a few tourist trap fees. I am now standing in front of the biggest church in the world! *(by height and exterior size)*



Basilica only took 3 years to build and gifted to the Vatican; built by the first president 1986-1989 to finish; Pope came 1990; 120 meters, outside 158; Rome is 44 acre, here is 138 acre; it is both the tallest and the biggest; 7000 can sit, 11000 can stand; 
today is Sunday and the 10am mass had already finished, guide told stories of the weight and construction, as well as how anyone can visit it
Seeing the 1st president's crocodile lake; visiting the Hotel Des Parlimentaires, with the unique architecture; Merceline has never visited here before and started to ask me to take so many pictures of her; on the way back to ABJ, she mentioned that she wants to get out of CI and work hard for 1 year in another country to buy a house, since her parents died and there are many grand siblings
