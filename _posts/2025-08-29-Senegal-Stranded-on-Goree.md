![Senegal Flag]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/flags/4x3/sn.svg){:height="36px" width="36px"} Senegal \| Country 37 \| 7 day \|

My first country in West Africa, all my travels had prepared me poorly for this region of the world. 

* As many have warned, West Africa is expensive, harsh and rough for travelers. Fortunately, Senegal is one of the safest countries in the region.
* French and Wolof are the main languages of the region. Senegal was the capital of French West Africa, and maintained close relations.
* Islam is the dominant religion in this country, and in particular, the Sufi Mouride Brotherhood popularized by Amadou Bamba of Touba. His face is everywhere in this country, from cars, buses ...etc.
* Goree island was particularly the hub of slave trade many centuries ago, as it's the convenient port to the New World from West Africa. 
* For breakfast, the locals like to eat a french baguette with meat and fries inside. And Muslim tea was everywhere.

### Day 1: Layover and Central Dakar

I arrived in the early morning with a 10 hour layover. My guide Becaye is taking me arround from the airport for a day tour. 

We stopped briefly for a gas station breakfast, and began the long hour long ride into Dakar. 

Becaye is an older gentleman who works as a translator for his day job. He spoke great English and would sometimes go "comment dit ton" when an English word failed to pop up.

He signaled to me multiple times that quite a few guarded places in Dakar are French military bases; the French is vacating some of them.

There are many colorful mini buses ðŸšŒ here with bright yellow, blue, white colors, and folks are wearing African robes (long sleeves and pants) in the very hot and humid weather.   

We saw the Mosque of the Divinity in Dakar, with 2 bright red towers. 

![mosque_divinity]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/mosque_divinity.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Very close to the Mosque is the towering African Renaissance monument. You can see it from very far away. 

![african_renaissance]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/african_renaissance.jpeg){:width="50%"}![view]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/view.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*The monument is a man, woman and child pointing towards the future; there are many steps to get to the monument*

This is a symbol of Africa's rise in the 21st century, designed by an African architect but built the North Koreans.

After waiting a bit and taking in the view of Dakar and the ocean, we went up to the top of the African Renaissance monument through a narrow elevator to the 15th floor. 

![head]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/head.jpeg){:width="50%"}![top]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/top.jpeg){:width="50%"}

At the very top of the statue, we are inside the man's head, and can see the mother and child from a completely different angle. There is room to walk around in the circle around the elevator. 

On the bottom 3 floors, we had many African countries' traditional masks and symbols, given to the monument when it was completed in 2010.

I then went with Becaye to the fish market, and bought a muslim tea from a walking vendor. After the fish market, we also visited the Art village for some light souvenir shopping.

![fish_market]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/fish_market.jpeg){:width="50%"}![thieboudienne]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/thieboudienne.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Thieboudienne in Wolof means fish and rice.*

After spending a while to exchange my USD payment to XOF (they were unhappy with the newer $20 USD bills), we went to have lunch with of course the national dish, Thieboudienne.

It is composed of Jolof rice, fish, yuca, African eggplant and more. You can taste the mixture of sweet and savory, balancing the spices and the fish. Along with the Thieboudienne, we drank the baobak drink, which comes from the fruits of the baobab trees here. 

We arrived at the Dakar port to try to get to Goree island. Unfortunately Becaye didn't know the ferry schedule, and we couldn't make it this time due to my next flight. 

We drove back to the airport for my flight to the Gambia as it started to rain. My first impression of Senegal was fantastic! 

### Coming back to Dakar, staying in Oukam

The good impression was unfortunately very quickly wiped off as I came back to Dakar two days later. 

At around 2am in the morning, a driver and I agreed on the price to get to Dakar. However, as we drove 5 minutes away from the airport, in the middle of nowhere, he stops and says that he had misunderstood where I was going, and that the price is actually 3x what it was. 

This was crazy stressful in the pitch black early morning, being extorted for more $ with a stranger. I insisted that we come back to the airport, and he finally agreed. 

Fortunately I had a much better experience with a different driver. After a very long ride, I called my poor Airbnb host, who had his brother sleep at the unit, and gave me the keys at around 4:30am. 

### Day 2: Goree troubles and Getting Orange phone plan

![apartment]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/apartment.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Thank you my employer R who provided me the wonderful flexibility to explore Senegal. Unfortunately for me, I realized that I had VPN issues with the apartment wifi. 

My first order of the day is to get a phone plan with data to access VPN. Through a Yango ride, I came to the Sea plaza, where after about one hour of trying, I had an Orange phone plan for the week. 

Close by to the plaza is the Place du Souvenir Africain, celebrating African leaders and heritage.

![africa]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/africa.jpeg){:width="50%"}![place_du_souvenir_africain]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/place_du_souvenir_africain.jpeg){:width="50%"}

I then visited the Dakar Port again, to finally visit Goree island. 

At the ferry ticket office, I heard someone yelling repeatedly, "where is ticket?". I bumped into a fellow Chinese traveler, Leo, who had been to 130+ countries and is very experienced. Leo is from HongKong but living in New York, and currently traveling his way south. 

![terminal]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/terminal.jpeg){:width="50%"}![goree]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/goree.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Leo had this whole chicken from Auchan, a popular grocery chain. And he was eating the chicken whole on the boat :)*

We buddied up and explored the island together.

![palace]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/palace.jpeg){:width="50%"}

*There are many goats and cats on the island*

Goree island is the most famous island and westward departure point for slaves for the new world, it's a small and mostly abandoned island with about 1000 inhabitants working in local tourism. 

I estimate that rim to rim is about a 30 mins walk. We walked up to the famous House of Slaves, but it was unfortunately closed. 

![house_of_slaves]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/house_of_slaves.jpeg){:width="50%"}![beach]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/beach.jpeg){:width="50%"}

We also visited the Fort, which had a museum about slave trade here on the island from the 1600s to the 1800s. There were so many countries and traders here on Goree, all heading to the new world. 

![fort]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/fort.jpeg){:width="50%"}![fort1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/fort1.jpeg){:width="50%"}

As 5:30 approached, we headed back to the ferry terminal. Then suddenly, huge clouds approached us at record speed. All the vendors and shops had quickly packed up. 

Leo and I ran behind a restaurant cover. Our initial plan was to wait for the boat to deboard and run for it. However, we were surprised that the boat was moving. 

![storm]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/storm.jpeg){:width="50%"}![boat_trapped]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/boat_trapped.jpeg){:width="50%"}

We ran towards it with all our strength in the crushing rain. Leo and I thought that we had missed the boat. Then we saw that the rope that the boat anchored on had broke free. 

The boat was desparately trying to anchor itself on the shore, but the winds were too great. Soaking wet, we hid in the restaurant cover by the beach, alongside many families, who were as cold and stressed as we were. 

For the next few hours, the boat slowly unboarded. People and stock were unloaded. 

![flipped]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/flipped.jpeg){:width="50%"}![wait]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/wait.jpeg){:width="50%"}

For three time this evening, there was this pattern that everyone rushed to the port in the rain, only to be turned back, because the boat was not ready. It turned out that the boat had issues on its own. 

At around 9pm, in the dark, we finally boarded the boat as the rain drizzled. The lines and people pushing in the lines were crazy. So many people speaking languages that we barely understand, pushing, rushing, skin to skin. 

![rescue]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/rescue.jpeg){:width="28%"}![group]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/group.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Through this, we met this really friendly group of young Senegalese women on the boat, who conversed with us in broken French and Google translate. We exchanged WhatsApps and our group pictures, relieved to finally be going home.

And just as we thought that we were finally safe, there was an announcement that we need to board a different boat, as the original one had sustained damage. 

Fortunately, at around 10:30pm, we were finally back on the mainland. 

![independence_square]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/independence_square.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Leo and I walked to the independence square, and said our goodbyes. He was traveling to the Gambia via land border tomorrow. (And unfortunately he was unsuccessful, and had to fly to Ivory Coast instead, but that's a different story)

Leo's last quote to me: niceness is weakness in West Africa.

### Life in Dakar

From Tuesday to Friday, I walked the streets of Dakar, breathing in the hustle and bustle, and what life was like in West Africa. 

![downtown]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/downtown.jpeg){:width="50%"}![downtown2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/downtown2.jpeg){:width="28%"}

Dakar is actually a lot like Manhattan, with a core downtown area, but many suburbs. 

I visted the biggest market, the Sandaga, and saw many shops selling everything. 

![grand_mosque]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/grand_mosque.jpeg){:width="50%"}![african_museum]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/african_museum.jpeg){:width="28%"}
*Left: Grand mosque; Right: African museum*

In the African museum, I learned about Cheikh Anta Diop, who had came up with the Afrocentricity work while he was doing his dissertation in France. He had studied the languages of West Africans and proposed that the ancient Egyptians are connected to West Africans. This implied that the whole human population had come from Africa.  

The museum also had an exhibit dedicated to Faye, the country's newest president since 2024. 

I also visited quite a few beach places in the outskirts of Dakar. 

![ngor]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/ngor.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Ngor is an island about 5 mins away from the Northern shore of Dakar. I bought a ticket at the beach and took a small boat to there and back.

![ngor_walk]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/ngor_walk.jpeg){:width="50%"}![resort_ngor]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/resort_ngor.jpeg){:width="50%"}

The island itself is about a 10 mins walk end to end with small meandering roads. There are many hotels and surf camps on the island, as well as many art galleries.

Right next to Ngor, I had also visited the almadies, where many expats and wealthy live. This area of Dakar featured many white expats, and small children on the sides of the roads asking for money. This is probably the only part of Dakar where I encountered these children, who would shake their buckets and follow you aggressively. 

![almadies]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/almadies.jpeg){:width="50%"}

One fascinating fact is that Dakar has a (limited) train system built by the french that is exactly like the ones in Europe. After a hot day outside in the traffic, I am so relieved to take a rest and take a stop of the train.

![dakar_gates]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/dakar_gates.jpeg){:width="50%"}![train]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/train.jpeg){:width="50%"}

I really enjoyed the daily exploration of Dakar.

*Left: drawing of Door of no return; Right: bus stop featuring Bamba*

Throughout my time here, I had frequented this restaurant by my apartment. I always ask to get Thieboudienne, but the food is not always available. 

![restaurant]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/restaurant.jpeg){:width="50%"}![food]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/food.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*I had to refreshen up my french "A Emporter" for takeouts instead of dining in*

### Bandia Reserve and Lake Somone

On Saturday, my last day, I visited the Bandia Reserve (pronounced with the 'ja' sound). It is much closer to Saly (a beach city away from Dakar) and the airport. 

Mr. Fallou, our driver, picked me up from Oukam bus station, and we joined the organizer at the Banjia park. 

While we waited in the parking lot for more visitors, a monkey walked up to a Spanish tourist and grabbed his bag. The audacity!

![bandia_baobab]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/bandia_baobab.jpeg){:width="50%"}![safari]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/safari.jpeg){:width="50%"}

The safari started, and right away, we saw many giraffes roaming the reserve. I learned that the giraffe walks one side at a time (left-left, right-right) just like the camel, unlike dogs, cats and others that walk left-right-left-right. 

![friends]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/friends.jpeg){:width="28%"}![antelope]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/antelope.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Right: Antelopes*

![buffalo]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/buffalo.jpeg){:width="50%"}![monkey]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/monkey.jpeg){:width="50%"}

The safari guide was a female and was the original guide since the reserve started in the 1990s. When we saw the buffalos, she made the joke that the buffalos are just like the Senegalese men, they follow the herd and fight each other to mate with the female. 

We saw so many herbivores (and only herbivores in this reserve), like the wild boars, antelopes, impalas, yellow birds...etc. 

![stuck]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/stuck.jpeg){:width="50%"}![ostrich]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/ostrich.jpeg){:width="50%"}

At one point, we also saw that the car in front of us had been stuck in the mud, and they had to be rescued. 

Our final stop in the reserve is the "cemetary baobab". There are 120+ sets of bones that are buried within the tree, and that the tree is 1000+ years old.

![cemetary]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/cemetary.jpeg){:width="50%"}![bandia_sign]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/bandia_sign.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Right: Mr. Fallou who drove me for the game day, as well as the airport transfers the next day*

Our next stop is Lake Somone, situated right by Saly and part of the Mbour area. 

It is a beautiful lagoon that is right by the Atlantic ocean. In fact, the beach that separates the two is only about a 2 minute walk. But boy, the hot sand was burning up my feet, and I had to wear my shoes for cover. 

![somone]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/somone.jpeg){:width="50%"}![crabs]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/crabs.jpeg){:width="50%"}
*Right: Thousands of tiny crabs crawling on an uninhabbited island in the lake*

We are taking a boat tour of Lake Somone. There were so many birds, harons and little crabs, with mangroves all around us. 

At one point, we accientally ran into the mangroves. The boat driver stopped, maneauvered carefully to the front of the boat, and got us unstuck.

![mangrove]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/mangrove.jpeg){:width="50%"}![oyster_farm]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/senegal/oyster_farm.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Our tour guide told us all about the impressive houses by the shores, and complained that the European (French) people who owned the homes should give back the wealth to the country.

The ocean breeze and mangroves made me forget about work, which has been giving be a lot of pressure lately. It was so beautiful, serene.

This was a wonderful end to my week long trip in Senegal, to witness the local culture and nature. 

In the dawn of the Sunday morning, Mr Fallou picked me up and I said goodbyes to Dakar (funnily, it was raining again).
