For my July 2022 break, I traveled to Panama and Colombia.

On the first day, I stayed at the W, in the heart of downtown. I got a bit of Panamanian Balboa from the ATM. 

Panama is a financial powerhouse and has a chic and modern downtown.

I ventured around and received assistance from a Chinese family-run shop to obtain a SIM card. There are quite a few Chinese from the days of building the canal.

The nicer parts of Panama City remind me so much of Miami.

### Panama Canal

I went to Miraflores Locks and toured the museum. Watching the ships pass by was a great experience.

After the French failed to complete it, the US government built the canal and controlled the surrounding land until the late 20th century, when Panamanians reclaimed it through protests.

### Old Town and Ruins

I visited Casco Viejo, the protected historic district that serves as the former town center, and the ruins of the original Panama City, which pirates burned down centuries ago.

### Life in Panama

Outside of downtown, the city has an industrial feel. It's not quite South America, even though it was part of Gran Colombia. I quite enjoyed the plantain and ceviche.

I did come across protests on my way to Panama university. Life is busy and people are fighting for change.

I left after 3 short days, and travelled onwards towards Colombia.
