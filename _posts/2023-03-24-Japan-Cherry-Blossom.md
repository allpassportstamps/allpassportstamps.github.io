My month long sabbatical is coming to an end. It has been eye opening visiting Oceania and South East Asia. Having been on the road for quite a while, I knew I wanted to end the trip with relative comfort. 

After a stressful but orderly experience going through immigration, I arrived in Japan. 

Some aspects of the Japan trip that I find really unique:
* Almost 0 obesity and so much walking everywhere
* It's really hard to remember cultural etiquettes precisely such as receiving things with two hands and not eating while walking
* Convenience stores are superb even for Asia standards (Lawson, FamilyMart, 7-Eleven)

### Food 

It has been raining, and I have been moving around quite a bit from hotel to hotel. These subway lockers are a godsend, making it so easy to store luggage efficiently.

I am staying at pod hotels (e.g. Manga themed) throughout my time in Japan and it's an experience in of itself.

*Restaurants are selling pre-packed lunch bentos right outside*

Food in Japan is so different. There are so many self-serve options at places where human interactions are minimal, from conveyer belt sushi to food cubicles. 

For instance, one of my most frequented restaurants in Osaka has ordering done by a ticketing machine.

*Healthy and affordable (unlike Japanese food in the US)*

There are amazing ramen places like Ichiran, where you fill out a form and sit at booths with dividers to minimize human interactions.

But there are also tons of very social restaurants like the Izakayas. Everyone is sitting so close to everyone else around the chef, where the cooking is done right in front of you.

Of course, convenience stores like 7-Eleven, Lawson, and FamilyMart are amazing! People could easily eat from convenience store selections for weeks without getting bored.

### Tokyo is BIG!

There are so many neighborhoods in Tokyo, akin to New York's boroughs, but even more varied.

Harajuku, the heart of 'kawaii' culture, was where I visited an animal cafe and held a ferret and porcupine for the first time.

Shinjuku is the nightlife capital. My tour guide said that a lot of folks sleep on the streets if they can't get home before the subways close at midnight. 

Godzilla and the adult industry make an interesting combination at night.

Shibuya is a lot of things, but above all shopping. 

![crossing]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/crossing.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Akihabara is renowned for its otaku culture and electronics. There are definitely interesting otaku-catering "services" right out on the streets.

### Tokyo Life

I accidentally visited Japan during cherry blossom season and they are absolutely beautiful.

![cherry]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/cherry.jpeg){:width="50%"}![cherry2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/cherry2.jpeg){:width="50%"}

I am not sure how I feel about bidets, but you know, I can get used to it. 

![bidet]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/bidet.jpeg){:width="28%"}

The popular religion is called Shinto and there are shrines all around.

And lastly, Japan is the capital of Anime.

### Osaka, Nara and Kobe

I traveled to and from Osaka by overnight bus. I had great sleep, and they are very comfortable. 

![osaka]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/osaka.jpeg){:width="50%"}![osaka2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/osaka2.jpeg){:width="28%"}

The entertainment part of Osaka is the Dotonbori, and it's so lively! 

![dotonbori]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/dotonbori.jpeg){:width="50%"}![dotonbori2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/dotonbori2.jpeg){:width="28%"}

Osaka is much more easy going than Tokyo. 

I went on a day trip to Nara and a separate day trip to Kobe. 

Nara is of course famous for the bowing deer. They are everywhere and very aggressive. The vendors all sell the rice crackers. The deer are polite but persistent. 

![nara]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/nara.jpeg){:width="50%"}![nara2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/nara2.jpeg){:width="50%"}

Kobe is famous for its wagyu. I waited more than 1.5 hours at a restaurant for lunch to experience it. The beef just melts as soon as it comes inside your mouth, like drinking down melted cheese. 

![kobe]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/kobe.jpeg){:width="50%"}![kobe2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/kobe2.jpeg){:width="50%"}

![kobe3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/japan/kobe3.jpeg){:width="50%"}

I had a very very close call, getting lost in Osaka, arriving to my bus to Tokyo. Fortunately, I made it :) 

There's still so much of Japan left for me to explore, and I'm certain I'll be back!
