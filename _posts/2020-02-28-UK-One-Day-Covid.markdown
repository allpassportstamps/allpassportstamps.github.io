>I was in London for less than 48 hours. It was the beginning of COVID, and London was quickly shutting down. Not wanting to waste my tickets, I made a somewhat irresponsible short trip to satisfy my travel itch.

I spent my single day in London being quite the tourist.

## Being a Tourist

Having lived in the Commonwealth, "visiting the Queen" has been on my bucket list. Unfortunately, not all the iconic landmarks were picture-ready.

*Big Ben and Buckingham Palace*

For dinner, I enjoyed a pie from Borough Market. Experiencing some jet lag, I roamed London at 3 AM, eating McDonald's while looking at all the Brexit posters around the streets.

For the next day's breakfast, I found Pret A Manger to be exquisite.

## Wimbledon

As an avid tennis fan since middle school, I took the Underground to SW19 / Wimbledon. It's quite a suburban neighborhood, with residential houses surrounding the All England Club. I missed seeing Roger Federer or Pete Sampras play here by just a few months!

## Am I In Trouble?

On my way back to Gatwick Airport, I tapped into the subway system as usual.

Little did I know, the fare checker informed me that my ticket was not valid.

Because I was short on time, I paid the fine to the Metro worker and hurried back to the airport. *I later complained to my credit card company during the COVID lockdowns and had a back and forth with the Metro.*

Hopefully, I'll still be able to ride the Underground the next time I'm back!
