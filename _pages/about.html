Visiting all countries. 

Who knows if I will be able to accomplish this? I do know that I will be becoming a better person at the end of all this. 

I got the idea to visit every country when I finished visiting all 50 states of America. It made me realize that I truly enjoy meeting people, learning history and trying new foods.

I dream about 
* North America - 23 countries 
* South America - 12 countries
* Europe - 45 countries
* Africa - 54 countries
* Asia - 45 countries 
* Oceania - 14 countries
