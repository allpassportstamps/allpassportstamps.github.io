Visiting all countries. 

Who knows if I will be able to accomplish this? I do know that I will be growing and learning. 

I got the idea to visit every country when I finished visiting all 50 states of America. The joy of meeting people, learning history and trying new food got to me. 

I want to know about 
* Africa - 54 countries
* Asia - 45 countries 
* Europe - 45 countries
* North America - 23 countries 
* Oceania - 14 countries 
* South America - 12 countries
