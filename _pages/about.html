**Tell me about yourself.**

Hello, my name is Jason from California. I love history and I want to leave my mark in the history books. 

**Why are you writing this blog?**

With every passing day, I am forgetting more and more details of my trips. One day, I want to look back and live through these experiences once again. 

**How are you affording this travel?**

Working hard at my day job. Having an incredibly understanding partner. Credit card points.
